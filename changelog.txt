+ : Added feature

4.1 7th Feb 2014
* Fixes for UI2.0 and some improvements
= Simplified "Quick Start" instructions.
! Due to font changes in UI2.0, pixel coordinates have changed.
= New Default coordinates for 1080p - create a new profile or delete your INI file to get them.
= Calibration Mode now makes many less pixel checks
= Using zoom hotkeys in Calibration Mode now works (ie you can test in Calibration Mode)
+ Bindings added to quickly copy the colour from the Current to the Target box in Calibration Mode.
  If you have good coordinates, this can be used to quickly configure colour values without having to use copy and paste.
  Recommended bindings: Shift-F1 to Shift-F4
= Vastly improved debug mode.
  Improved layout
  Gives pixel colour on failed detect
= General under the hood optimizations

4.0 10th Dec 2013
= Reworked the method by which zooms are carried out.
  This version should be quicker in performing zooms.
  All intermediate zooms are gone - old method to get from 1 to 3 would be to to 1->2, check arrival in 2 OK, then 2->3, check arrival in 3 OK.
  Now it is 1->3 (Hit zoom twice quickly), check arrival in 3 OK.
  The speed of the zoom is directly governed by the "Zoom Repeat Delay" setting, and actual matches behave differently to Testing Grounds.
  Be sure to either leave "Zoom Repeat Delay" at it's default of 150, or adjust while in an actual game, not Testing Grounds!
+ Normal" mode should work better on mouse wheel now.
  For example, if at zoom 3 and you roll the mouse down twice quickly, it should never attempt to hit zoom 1.5

3.0 5th Dec 2013
= Reworked internal structure.
  Should result in it being much easier to control cases where you roll the mouse wheel too many times and unwanted zooms are queued.
  Toggle min/max mode should be much less jumpy now.

2.5 5th Dec 2013
+ Added "Zoom Out sends Adv Zoom in Min/Max mode" option, plus a box to set which key to use for Advanced Zoom
  Intended for use with mouse wheel - set Zoom Mode to "Min / Max Toggle", then tick this and the "Enable Advanced Zoom" option.
  Then wheel up will toggle min/max normal zoom, wheel down will toggle Advanced Zoom.
  
2.4 5th Dec 2013
+ Advanced Zoom module now fully supported
  WARNING! You may need to re-calibrate to make use of it.
  If you play in 1080p res, the default settings should work - so try adding a new profile.
+ Update Notifications are now enabled for this application.
= Experimental head tracking / joystick support removed.

2.3 30th Aug 2013
= Improved reliability - sometimes 3.0x would be mis-detected as 1.0x.
  The script now knows what zoom to expect next after a keypress.
  If it detects a zoom other than expected, it re-tries to verify before re-issuing another zoom.
  eg, before if you were at 1.5x, and zoomed in, if it thought it detected 1.0x after you zoomed in, it would hit zoom again.
  Now, it knows to expect 1.5x next, and if it fails to detect 1.5x three times in a row, gives up without hitting zoom again.
+ Much more info now displayed in debug mode.

  
2.2 29th Aug 2013
+ Added "Monitor" readout to monitor value of stick input for head tracking.
  Should allow users to find the correct stick ID / Axis, and also help debugging

2.1 29th Aug 2013
+ Experimental head tracking support.
  Allows you to control zoom by leaning closer to the screen.
  Requires EITHER:
  TrackIR (In Joystick Emulation Mode)
  OR
  FaceTrackNoIR (Free) plus a supported Webcam (Default settings, set "Game Protocol" to "vJoy")
  Then choose the axis that represents lean (Z axis) in the Zoom GUI

2.0 29th Aug 2013
= Completely redesigned logic.
  The pixel detection routine is the same, but that is about it.
  New technique finds out what zoom you are in when you hit zoom...
  ...then hits zoom and waits until it sees the next expected zoom before sending any more zooms.
  Should be much more reliable.

1.10 28th Aug 2013
= Fixed newly introduced bug where it would retry zoom indefinitely if it failed to detect zoom rate

1.9 28th Aug 2013
= Tweaks to max zoom mode for reliability.
+ If zoom is attempted but it cannot detect pixels, it tries again up to 3 times
+ Option to play debug sounds. This should help me solve reliability issues.

1.8 28th Aug 2013
+ Max Zoom option is now a dropdown - Normal / Max Zoom / Toggle Min/Max
  Use the Toggle Min/Max feature to only need one button to toggle between min and max zoom

1.7 28th Aug 2013
+ Further tweaks to max zoom mode

1.6 28th Aug 2013
+ Fixed max zoom - was only working in Testing Grounds

1.5 28th Aug 2013
+ Added "Max Zoom Only" setting - Enable to only use 3x zoom (skip 1.5x zoom)

1.4 27th Aug 2013
+ Default settings should now work for 1080p (1920x1080)
+ Added "Zoom repeat delay" to help tune for wider FOVs, slower machines etc.

1.3 27th Aug 2013
= Much improved input handling
  Now if you roll spam zoom in (ie roll the mouse wheel up multiple times) it will queue zoom ins nicely
  ie two Wheel Ups in rapid succession should now reliably zoom in to full
  Also issues with the script getting confused in cases like this seem to be improved

1.2 27th Aug 2013
= Messed with timings

1.1 27th Aug 2013
+ Added Homepage Link

1.0 27th Aug 2013
* Initial Release
