+ : Added feature

2.1 29th Aug 2013
+ Experimental head tracking support.
  Allows you to control zoom by leaning closer to the screen.
  Requires EITHER:
  TrackIR (In Joystick Emulation Mode)
  OR
  FaceTrackNoIR (Free) plus a supported Webcam (Default settings, set "Game Protocol" to "vJoy")
  Then choose the axis that represents lean (Z axis) in the Zoom GUI

2.0 29th Aug 2013
= Completely redesigned logic.
  The pixel detection routine is the same, but that is about it.
  New technique finds out what zoom you are in when you hit zoom...
  ...then hits zoom and waits until it sees the next expected zoom before sending any more zooms.
  Should be much more reliable.

1.10 28th Aug 2013
= Fixed newly introduced bug where it would retry zoom indefinitely if it failed to detect zoom rate

1.9 28th Aug 2013
= Tweaks to max zoom mode for reliability.
+ If zoom is attempted but it cannot detect pixels, it tries again up to 3 times
+ Option to play debug sounds. This should help me solve reliability issues.

1.8 28th Aug 2013
+ Max Zoom option is now a dropdown - Normal / Max Zoom / Toggle Min/Max
  Use the Toggle Min/Max feature to only need one button to toggle between min and max zoom

1.7 28th Aug 2013
+ Further tweaks to max zoom mode

1.6 28th Aug 2013
+ Fixed max zoom - was only working in Testing Grounds

1.5 28th Aug 2013
+ Added "Max Zoom Only" setting - Enable to only use 3x zoom (skip 1.5x zoom)

1.4 27th Aug 2013
+ Default settings should now work for 1080p (1920x1080)
+ Added "Zoom repeat delay" to help tune for wider FOVs, slower machines etc.

1.3 27th Aug 2013
= Much improved input handling
  Now if you roll spam zoom in (ie roll the mouse wheel up multiple times) it will queue zoom ins nicely
  ie two Wheel Ups in rapid succession should now reliably zoom in to full
  Also issues with the script getting confused in cases like this seem to be improved

1.2 27th Aug 2013
= Messed with timings

1.1 27th Aug 2013
+ Added Homepage Link

1.0 27th Aug 2013
* Initial Release
